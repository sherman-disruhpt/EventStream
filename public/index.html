    <h1>Hello!</h1>

    <p>Welcome to the Front-End engineering exercise for <a href="https://frontapp.com">Front</a>.</p>

    <p>Your role is to update this javascript application to:</p>

    <ul class="tasks">
      <li>Handle the events received via websocket (cf: <pre>Store#handleEvent</pre>).</li>
      <li>Implement <pre>Store#conversations</pre> to return the list of conversations stored in your app.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Note: In a real time application we would display the list of conversations and messages in a UI similar to Front web
      application.
      Here we will simply display the number of conversations: <strong id="conversations-count">0</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      By clicking on "Start" bellow, your client will start receiving events from the server.<br>
      Once all the events have been received, the application will log the result of your test in your dev tools console.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ready? <br>
      <input id="stream" type="button" value="Start streaming"> or
      <input id="step-by-step" type="button" value="Receive next event">
    </p>

    <p>
      Good luck,<br>
      --<br>
      The engineering team at Front
